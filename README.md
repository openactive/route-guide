# routes
Specification for describing outdoor-activity Routes

## Overview

The Routes specification describes a proposed new type (`Route`) of `Opportunity`, as defined by the [OpenActive Modelling Opportunity Data 2.0](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/) specification. Its purpose is to describe Routes used for recreational activities e.g. hiking, running, and cycling in sufficient detail to encourage greater use of these Routes.

## Status

Work has not yet begun on the Routes specification itself. As a result work-to-date (5 July 2019) should be seen as 'notes toward' a specification, and is not definitive.

### Contributing to the Discussion

Participants interested in contributing further to the discussion are encouraged to join the [OpenActive W3C community](https://w3c.openactive.io/), particularly the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-openactive/) and [biweekly calls](https://w3c.openactive.io/meeting-calendar). 

New proposals and discussion related to the Routes specification should be opened as GitHub Issues (i.e., by clicking 'Issues' in the tab menu above, and then the green 'New Issue' button on the resulting page).

Participants in the Routes Use-Case workshop may, however, choose to comment directly on the [documents themselves](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mR_dov8w33tdWPdnRBiwW4eBxqyTmQQL).

## Further Information

Routes started life as a proposal related to the Opportunity specification: see further [Modelling Opportunity Data Issue 108](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/108).
